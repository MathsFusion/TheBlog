        <h2>Understanding Momentum</h2>
        <p>In classical mechanics, an object that is in motion will have momentum, which has symbol \( \vec{p} \) and calculated as mass(m) &#8226;velocity(\( \vec{v} \)). But what does this really mean? When described with an object in motion, mass is the scalar value that describes how resistant an object is to a change in velocity(acceleration), and we have velocity, a vector quantity which is the speed of the object in a direction. In terms of vectors momentum is the velocity of an object scaled by mass. This new vector quantity, (with units kgm/s) has the property of the resistance to the change from the current direction of travel. This description is very limited in use as is hard to imagine and so isn't very intuitive, for example a bus and a car moving around a corner at the same speed will look identical in motion, but their masses are different, and so the momentum change is different.
            </p>
        <div class="extra-info">
            <p>As newtons first law of motion tells us, an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force. This means that momentum is conserved under balanced forces, which is useful as later we learn that while kinetic energy is lost, momentum isn't.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Now to understand in more depth this relationship of mass and velocity, we need to apply a force to our object, and so has unbalanced forces. Newton's second law states that the rate of change of momentum is force.
                So \( \vec{F} \) = \( \frac{ &#916  \vec{p} }{ &#916 t} \) = \( \frac{&#916 m &#916  \vec{v} }{&#916 t} \).
                Now if the mass stays constant: \( \frac{m &#916  \vec{v} }{&#916 t} \) and so m\( \vec{a} \) (mass * acceleration).
                So if mass doubles, force must double for the same acceleration \( \frac{ \vec{F} }{ m } \) = \( \vec{a} \) and the opposite is true in 1D (it gets more complicated in more dimensions as you can't directly divide vectors by vectors), if &#916 v doubles for the same time, force must double for the same mass. So rate of change in velocity and mass both influence the force.
            </p>
        <p>An easy example to think about momentum is when it comes to making a car or lorry come to a stop, if you increase mass of the vehicle before braking, then it will take more time for the same force and likewise with a greater initial velocity it will take more time for the same force, and so a greater force is needed to stop a vehicle of greater mass and velocity, so as velocity and mass have this same property, we couple them into momentum.
            </p>
        <p>A harder, yet better example in 2D, If we imagine a rocket moving through space with a constant velocity in the y direction(forwards) suddenly gets a constant force acting only in the x-axis, causing the object's x velocity the increase. If we plot y position against x position, we see it's movement,
            </p>
        <canvas id="parametricChart1" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
            <p>Note: The axis values are arbitrary, it is more important to understand the graph's curve and compare relative values with other graphs.
            </p>
        <p>
            As the x velocity is increasing, we see that the x position in increasing at a faster and faster rate, as velocity is increasing, as we would expect.
                <br>Now, note what happens when we double mass and calculate for the same time,

        </p>
        <canvas id="parametricChart2" width="400" height="200"></canvas>

        <p>
            We see that, as acceleration is half, due to a = \( \frac{F}{m} \), so the change in velocity in the x direction is half, so it takes longer per unit time(eg. seconds) to change the objects x position, but the y values remain the same per unit time as the first one.
                <br>Now if we double the velocity and calculate for the same time, we get a different effect,

        </p>
            <canvas id="parametricChart3" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
            <p>We see that the graph is stretched double in direction of y-axis(as y velocity has been doubled), but as mass is the same, our x velocity is changing at the same rate as the first one, so our x values are the same per unit time.
            </p>
        <p>
            It may not seem obvious what the link is, especially as momentum was doubled in both examples and opposite things happened, however you may begin to notice that the change in direction of movement over the same time was less when we doubled velocity and mass to the first example, if you look carefully at the end of the path, you can see the object moving at less of an angle from the y-axis in the last 2 and more in the first one. This is because their momentum was doubled, and it turns out that the angle the object was moving in was the exact same in the last 2 as their momentum was the same. However, please note, it did happen in different places in space, so individual value changes of v and m have different effects on the objects path but have an overall common effect and so are linked by multiplying these 2 effects.
                <br>The graphs below show the change in theta for the 3 scenarios as time went on.

            <div class="col-md-4">

            Where angle = tan<sup>-1</sup>
            \( (\frac{ xVelocity }{ yVelocity }) \)
        </p>
        <p>As momentum doubled, the angle change per unit time is less and so momentum affects how much a force changes an objects path, however be careful as when mass doubles, the change in x Velocity is halved, due to \( \frac{ F }{ m } \) = a and if initial velocity is double, then yVelocity is double so the value of the fraction is half, and so have the same effect on angle, but take a different path due to different parts of the momentum being affected.
            </p>
        <p>
            This is further illustrated in the math,
                <br>
            tan(&Theta;) = \( \frac{v_x}{v_y} \); as v<sub>x</sub>
            = at = \( \frac{F}{m} \)t; we get tan(&Theta;) = \( \frac{(\frac{F}{m}t)}{v_y} \); rearranging gives tan(theta) = \( \frac{Ft}{mv_y} \).
                <br>
            As initial momentum is v<sub>y</sub>
            m = p (as v<sub>x</sub>
            = 0), we see as initial momentum increases, for the same Force and time, the angle gets smaller. It doesn't matter if it is the mass or velocity increasing, it has the same effect on the angle.

        </p>
        <div class="challenge-div">
            <p>Challenge : Derive the equation for the angle with the momentum starting in any direction and a force in any direction</p>
        </div>
        <p>This aligns with the definition given at the start, and so now we have defined momentum, lets look into it's further uses.
            </p>
        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>Momentum, as mentioned earlier, is conserved provided that there are no unbalanced forces. This alone has limited uses when applied to a single object, however when we are talking about many objects, the statement momentum is conserved provided that there are no unbalanced forces on a system is better as if a force changes the momentum of 1 object in and equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to another object then momentum is still conserved as all the momentum that is gained/loss by the first object is loss/gained by the second object. Note each object experiences an unbalanced force, changing their momentum but the total momentum of the system that they are in has remained the same.
            </p>
        <p>
            For 2 objects, this can be written as: m<sub>1</sub>
            \( \vec{u_1} \) + m<sub>2</sub>
            \( \vec{u_2} \) = m<sub>1</sub>
            \( \vec{v_1} \) + m<sub>2</sub>
            \( \vec{v_2} \)
                <br>
            Where m means mass, u means initial velocity and v is equal to final velocity. The subscripts tell us which object we're describing.
                <br>
            Note: There are 6 unknowns, and so we need a lot of information to solve these problems, usually 4-5 parts.
                <br>Full Equation for 'n'(any) number of objects: \( \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {m_iu_i} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {m_iv_i} \)

        </p>
        <div class="extra-info">
            <p>This occurs more frequently than perhaps we think as Newton's third law of motion states that for every force that an object applies on another, there is an equal and opposite that is applied on the first object. So forces come in these pairs that conserve momentum, and so momentum conservation is very applicable.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Uses</h3>
        <p>
            - A big use of momentum conservation is in collisions of objects, as when an object bumps into another, the reaction force that it asserts onto the other is then, due to newtons third law, is felt in an opposite and equal way. So momentum is the same before and after a collision.
              <br>
            - 2 Massive bodies, for example if we isolated the sun and earth on their own, would exert a gravitational force on each-other, which is equal and opposite, and so the momentum at any point in time would be the same as another.
              <br>- Another example is rockets, as to get off the ground and accelerate, they eject gas at high speeds downwards, for momentum to be conserved, the rockets momentum must increase upwards, and as there are so many particles as great speeds, so lots of momentum downwards, this results in an effect that can lift the mass of a rocket. This also lets the rocket change speeds, even in space, as it is not relying on the particles in the air to push on, like planes.

        </p>
        <p>Momentum conservation is useful in countless examples, In the examples below I will address collisions however, once you understand how to apply momentum conservation to collisions, it is the same in any interaction, including the ones above, as there are always an equal and opposite change in momentum that will have the same momentum before and after.
            </p>
        <h3>What is Impulse?</h3>
        <p>When a bouncy ball bounces, how long does the collision go on for? Well it is close to being instant, and so when a force is applied over a very short amount of time, we give this the name impulse and calculate as I = Ft, as we know that force is delta p/t, so multiplying force by time is equivalent to change in momentum over the time the force is applied, so impulse is another name for change in momentum, but calculated in a different way.
            </p>
        <h2>Collisions</h2>
        <h3>Perfectly Inelastic Collisions</h3>
        <p>
            This is where maximum kinetic energy is lost (for a non-center-of-mass frame) and, as a consequence, is where the two (or more) objects stick together.
                <br>
            The second part is important as it let us reduce our equation for momentum conservation of 2 objects to;
                <br>
            \( m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = (m_1+m_2) v\) (The 1D equation for perfect inelastic momentum conservation)
                <br>As the objects join together, this lets us have only 1 object at the end, so 1 velocity and 1 mass(calculated as the sum). This lets us reduce our equation to 5 variables, so only 4 are needed to know the end result.

        </p>
        <h4>2D/3D - Vector Method</h4>
        <p>
            For this to work, the objects have to be perfectly aligned as if not then the final object will have rotation and so angular momentum and rotational energy which is defined as 'angular kinetic energy', and so not maximum amount of kinetic energy is lost, this is impractical.
                There is another key idea, momentum is conserved in its components, whether 2, 3 or more. This is because all the axes (x, y, z) don't affect one another, so no matter what I do to the x velocity, it won't affect the y velocity, as seen in the spaceship example above. Hence, Equation: \( m_1 \vec{u_1} + m_2 \vec{u_2} = (m_1+m_2) \vec{v}\)

            <!--                <br> In column vector notation (remove z axis for 2D):   \( m_1 \begin{bmatrix} u_{x1} \\ u_{y1} \\ u_{z1} \end{bmatrix} + m_2 \begin{bmatrix} u_{x2} \\ u_{y2} \\ u_{z2} \end{bmatrix} = (m_1 + m_2) \begin{bmatrix} v_x \\ v_y \\ v_z \end{bmatrix} \)-->
            <br>This equation is relatively easy to rearrange. eg. Equation for final velocity: \( \vec{v} = \frac{m_1 \vec{u_1} + m_2 \vec{u_2}}{m_1+m_2} \)

        </p>
        <h4>Special Occurrences</h4>
        <p>
            - When 2 objects of equal mass and speed collide head on, this leads to the case that the 2 objects stop, and though the 2 objects may not stick, they will be touching and as kinetic energy is lost, it is still inelastic.
                <br>-When mass is the same, equation simplifies to \( \vec{v} = \frac{ \vec{u_1} + \vec{u_2}}{2} \). This tells us that the final velocity will be the average velocity between the 2 objects, and is independent of mass.

        </p>
        <h3>Perfectly Elastic Collisions</h3>
        <p>
            This is where all kinetic energy is conserved, and objects bounce off of each-other. This is not common in our everyday life as kinetic energy usually get transferred to sound and heat. It is good when modeling particles on the atomic level, as there is no drag, and they have the Coulomb force pushing them, so don't actually 'touch' in the normal sense.
                This means that, for 2 objects, we can use:   \( \frac{1}{2}m_1u_1^{2} + \frac{1}{2}m_2u_2^{2} = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_1^{2} + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_2^{2}   \)
                <br>
            Multiply all parts by 2:    \( m_1u_1^{2} + m_2u_2^{2} = m_1v_1^{2} + m_2v_2^{2} \)
                <br>
            We Can use this equation to solve simultaneously (shown below) with the momentum equation to figure out 2 unknowns, so we only need 4 bits of information out of 6 total.

                <br>
            Momentum : \( m_1u_1 + m_2u_2 = m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 \)
                <br>
            Rearrange: \( m_1u_1 - m_1v_1 = m_2v_2 - m_2u_2 \)
                <br>
            Factorise: \( m_1(u_1 - v_1) = m_2(v_2 - u_2) \)

                <br>
            <br>
            Kinetic Energy : \( m_1u_1^{2} + m_2u_2^{2} = m_1v_1^{2} + m_2v_2^{2} \)
                <br>
            Rearrange: \( m_1u_1^{2} - m_1v_1^{2} = m_2v_2^{2} - m_2u_2^{2} \)
                <br>
            Factorise: \( m_1(u_1^{2} - v_1^{2}) = m_2(v_2^{2} - u_2^{2}) \)
                <br>
            Difference of 2 squares: \( m_1((u_1 - v_1)(u_1 + v_1)) = m_2((v_2 - u_2)(v_2 + u_2)) \)

                <br>
            <br>
            Divide Kinetic energy equation by momentum equation: \( \frac{m_1((u_1 - v_1)(u_1 + v_1))}{m_1(u_1 - v_1)} = \frac{m_2((v_2 - u_2)(v_2 + u_2))}{m_2(v_2 - u_2)} \)
                <br>
            Canceling terms gives us: \( u_1 + v_1 = v_2 + u_2 \)
                <br>
            <br>
            Now we have 2 equations, \( u_1 + v_1 = v_2 + u_2 \) and \( m_1u_1 + m_2u_2 = m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 \). The first one can be rearranged to cancel out a term in the second, eg: \( v_2 = u_1 + v_1 - u_2 \)
                <br>
            Substitute into momentum equation: \( m_1u_1 + m_2u_2 = m_1v_1 + m_2(u_1 + v_1 - u_2) \)
                <br>
            expand: \( m_1u_1 + m_2u_2 = m_1v_1 + m_2u_1 + m_2v_1 - m_2u_2 \)
                <br>
            rearrange and factorise: \( m_1u_1 + m_2u_2 + m_2u_2 - m_2u_1 = v_1(m_1 + m_2) \)
                <br>
            rearrange and factorise: \( \frac{2m_2u_2 + u_1(m_1 - m_2)}{m_1 + m_2} = v_1 \)
                <br>Note: this can be done to any 1 of the 4 velocities to eliminate it.

        </p>

            In higher dimensions, this becomes a lot more difficult, as if it is not a head on collision, like in 1D where they all are, then we need 1 more piece of information, the angle of collision as when they bounce off each-other, if the 2 objects hit at an angle, less momentum will be transferred than a direct head on collision. We didn't need to consider this in inelastic collisions, as we assumed that it was perfectly aligned, else it would rotate, and so wouldn't be inelastic. In elastic collisions we assume that there is no friction, as this would result in the objects rotating, and so could not use the conservation of kinetic energy.
                <br>This has 2 effects, the momentum parallel to the normal of the collision will undergo momentum before = momentum after and the velocity parallel to the tangent of the collision will not be affected, the end velocity can be calculated by adding these 2 velocities together. We will have a look at the trigonometric way and vector method to find final velocities of the 2 objects.

            Let \( \tan(\theta_c) = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} \);
                Let \( \tan(\theta_1) = \frac{u_{y1}}{u_{x1}} \);
                Let \( \tan(\theta_2) = \frac{u_{y2}}{u_{x2}} \);
                Let \( u_1 = \lvert \vec{u_1} \rvert \);
                Let \( u_2 = \lvert \vec{u_2} \rvert \);
                <br>
            <u>Normal</u>
            <br>
            Let \( u_{1n} = u_1 \cos(\theta_1-\theta_c) \);
                Let \( u_{2n} = u_2 \cos(\theta_2-\theta_c) \);
                <br>
            As normal component does momentum transfer. Using the formula from 1D, but substituting normal values in:
                <br>
            \( v_{1n} = \frac{2m_2u_{2n} + u_{1n}(m_1 - m_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \)
                <br>
            \( v_{2n} = \frac{2m_1u_{1n} + u_{2n}(m_2 - m_1)}{m_1 + m_2} \)
                <br>
            <u>Tangential</u>
            <br>
            Let \( u_{1t} = u_1 * \sin(\theta_1-\theta_c) \);
                Let \( u_{2t} = u_2 * \sin(\theta_2-\theta_c) \);
                <br>
            As tangential part not affected by collision;<br>
            Let \( v_{1t} = u_{1t} \);
                Let \( v_{2t} = u_{2t} \);
                <br>
            <u>Total</u>
            <br>
            Now we have 2 vectors, perpendicular to one another. Now to convert back to the standard axis that we started with.<br>
            \( v_{1x} = v_{1n}\cos(\theta_c) + v_{1t}\cos(90+\theta_c) \)
                <br>
            \( v_{1y} = v_{1n}\sin(\theta_c) + v_{1t}\sin(90+\theta_c) \)
                <br>
            \( v_{2y} = v_{2n}\cos(\theta_c) + v_{2t}\cos(90+\theta_c) \)
                <br>\( v_{2y} = v_{2n}\sin(\theta_c) + v_{2t}\sin(90+\theta_c) \)

        </p>
        <h4>2D - Vector Method</h4>
        <p>
            A more elegant solution, that can be scaled up to 3D very easily is the vector method.
                <br>
            Let the normal Vector = \( \vec{v_n} = \begin{bmatrix} y_2-y_1 \\ x_2-x_1 \end{bmatrix} \)
                <br>
            Let the unit normal = \( \hat{v_n} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{v_{nx}}{\lvert \vec{v_n} \rvert} \\ \frac{v_{ny}}{\lvert \vec{v_n} \rvert} \end{bmatrix} \)
                <br>
            Let the unit tangent = \( \hat{v_t} = \begin{bmatrix} -\hat{v_{ny}} \\ \hat{v_{nx}} \end{bmatrix} \)
                <br>
            <br>
            Then use the dot product, as it tells us how similar 2 vectors are (in terms of direction).
                <br>
            \( u_{1n} = \hat{v_{nx}}u_{1x} + \hat{v_{ny}}u_{1y} \)
                <br>
            \( u_{2n} = \hat{v_{nx}}u_{2x} + \hat{v_{ny}}u_{2y} \)
                <br>
            \( u_{1t} = \hat{v_{tx}}u_{1x} + \hat{v_{ty}}u_{1y} \)
                <br>
            \( u_{2t} = \hat{v_{tx}}u_{2x} + \hat{v_{ty}}u_{2y} \)
                <br>
            <br>
            As we know now, the normal part undergoes momentum change, and so we use the equation from 1D.
                <br>
            \( v_{1n} = \frac{u_{1n}(m_1-m_2) + 2m_2u_{2n}}{m_1+m_2} \)
                <br>
            \( v_{2n} = \frac{u_{2n}(m_2-m_1) + 2m_1u_{1n}}{m_1+m_2} \)
                <br>
            <br>
            And we know that the tangential part in not affected.
                <br>
            \( v_{1t} = u_{1t} \)
                <br>
            \( v_{2t} = u_{2t} \)

                <br>
            Then we multiply by the unit vectors to get back to x and y components.
                <br>
            \( \vec{v_{1(n)}} = (\hat{v_{nx}}v_{1n},  \hat{v_{ny}}v_{1y}) \)
                <br>
            \( \vec{v_{2(n)}} = (\hat{v_{nx}}v_{2x},  \hat{v_{ny}}v_{2y}) \)
                <br>
            \( \vec{v_{1(t)}} = (\hat{v_{tx}}v_{1x},  \hat{v_{ty}}v_{1y}) \)
                <br>
            \( \vec{v_{2(t)}} = (\hat{v_{tx}}v_{2x},  \hat{v_{ty}}v_{2y}) \)
                <br>
            <br>
            Finally, we add vectors together
                <br>
            \( \vec{v_1} = \vec{v_{1(n)}} + \vec{v_{1(t)}} \)
                <br>\( \vec{v_2} = \vec{v_{2(n)}} + \vec{v_{2(t)}} \)

        </p>
        <h4>Special Occurrences</h4>
        <p>
            - Now when the mass is the same and one of the objects starts at rest, notice what happens to the 2 equations;
                <br>
            Momentum simplifies to : \( u_1 = v_1 + v_2 \)
                <br>
            kinetic energy simplifies to : \( u_1^{2} = v_1^{2} + v_2^{2} \)
                <br>
            If we draw the vector diagram
                <br>
            [vector diagram]
                <br>Then we see that for the triangle to have the property \( u_1^{2} = v_1^{2} + v_2^{2} \), then it must be a right angle triangle, so the collision will always be at 90 degrees.

        </p>
        <h3>Partially Inelastic Collisions</h3>
        <p>
            Most common in everyday experience, and is where some kinetic energy is lost but the objects don't necessarily stick. This becomes similar to the totally elastic collision, as seen and described above, but with 1 extra needed variable; kinetic energy lost.
                <br>
            If we have this then we can readjust our kinetic equation;
                <br>
            \( m_1u_1^{2} + m_2u_2^{2} = k(m_1v_1^{2} + m_2v_2^{2}) \)
                <br>
            Where the coefficient k is between 0(all kinetic energy is lost) and 1(all kinetic energy is conserved). Then you can do the steps above, but with k in to calculate the unknown variable.
                <br>
            <br>
            Another way that it can be looked at is;
                <br>
            \( m_1u_1^{2} + m_2u_2^{2} = m_1v_1^{2} + m_2v_2^{2} + E \)
                <br>Where E = energy lost (to heat / sound)


        </p>
        <h3>Explosions</h3>
        <p>Increase Kinetic Energy, momentum conserved.
